## House Price Prediction Project

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. By analyzing real estate data, the model aims to provide accurate price estimates that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

### Objectives
- **Predict House Prices:** Develop a machine learning model to estimate the price of houses based on key features.
- **Feature Analysis:** Identify the most significant factors influencing house prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compare different machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective model for price prediction.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project includes information on house features such as location, number of rooms, square footage, and amenities. The data is sourced from a real estate database.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas:** Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library used for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model development and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries used for data visualization.

### Project Structure
- **data/:** Directory containing the dataset.
- **notebooks/:** Directory containing Jupyter notebooks with the analysis and model development.
- **src/:** Directory containing source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **README.md:** File providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.

### Key Insights
- **Location Impact:** Location was identified as a major factor in determining house prices.
- **Size Correlation:** Larger homes generally command higher prices, with a strong correlation between square footage and price.
- **Amenities:** Additional amenities like swimming pools and garages significantly increase the house's market value.

### Usage
To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rootsubhradeep/House-PricePrediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd House-PricePrediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to view the analysis and model development.
